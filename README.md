# Cars!
A website I needed to create for my high school's *Intro to Programming* class.

You should be able to visit the website via [GitHub Pages](https://supersonichub1.github.io/cars-personal-website/), but if you for some reason want to run this thing yourself, clone it and at the root run:
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
# Something to Note
This website makes use of some experimental CSS features such as `system-ui` and `background-filter`, so some elements may be rendered less readable or will be viewed in an unintended way. For the best experience, please use a browser based on Chromium.
# Images
